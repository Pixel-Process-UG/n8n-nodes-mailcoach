## üíª Development Workflow

### Making Changes

1. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Edit files in `nodes/` or `credentials/`
   - Follow existing code style
   - Add comments for complex logic

3. **Build and test**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   docker compose restart n8n
   ```

4. **Test in n8n**
   - Open http://localhost:5678
   - Test your changes thoroughly
   - Verify all operations still work

5. **Commit your changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add your feature description"
   ```

### Watch Mode for Development

For faster development, use watch mode:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Watch for changes
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: When ready to test
docker compose restart n8n
```

## üìù Coding Standards

### TypeScript Style
- Use TypeScript for all code
- Maintain type safety
- Follow existing code patterns
- Use meaningful variable names

### Code Structure
- Keep functions focused and small
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Handle errors gracefully
- Support `continueOnFail` option

### Formatting
```bash
# Format code
npm run format

# Lint code
npm run lint

# Fix linting issues
npm run lintfix
```

## üß™ Testing

### Before Submitting a PR

1. **Build successfully**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Test in Docker**
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   # Test all operations in n8n UI
   ```

3. **No TypeScript errors**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   # Should complete without errors
   ```

4. **Lint passes**
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   # Fix any issues with npm run lintfix
   ```

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Build completes without errors
- [ ] Node appears in n8n node selector
- [ ] Credentials work correctly

## üéØ Adding New Operations

If you're adding support for a new Mailcoach API endpoint:

1. **Check the Mailcoach API docs**
   - https://www.mailcoach.app/api-documentation

2. **Add to the node description**
   - Add new operation to the relevant resource in `properties`
   - Include all required and optional parameters

3. **Implement in execute method**
   ```typescript
   } else if (operation === 'yourNewOperation') {
       const param = this.getNodeParameter('param', i) as string;
       
       const response = await this.helpers.httpRequestWithAuthentication.call(
           this,
           'mailcoachApi',
           {
               method: 'GET',
               url: `${baseUrl}/your-endpoint`,
           },
       );
       
       returnData.push(response.data || response);
   }
   ```

4. **Update README.md**
   - Add the new operation to the operations list
   - Include usage examples if helpful

5. **Update CHANGELOG.md**
   - Document the new feature

## üêõ Debugging

### Common Issues

**Node doesn't appear in n8n:**
```bash
# Check if files are mounted
docker compose exec n8n ls -la /data/custom-nodes/n8n-nodes-mailcoach

# Check for build errors
npm run build

# Restart n8n
docker compose restart n8n
```

**TypeScript errors:**
```bash
# Clean rebuild
rm -rf dist
npm run build
```

**Testing in n8n:**
```bash
# View n8n logs
docker compose logs n8n -f

# Restart clean
docker compose down
docker compose up -d
```

- **Mailcoach PHP SDK**: https://github.com/spatie/mailcoach-sdk-php
- **TypeScript Handbook**: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/

## üé® Code Style

### File Naming
- Use PascalCase for class files: `Mailcoach.node.ts`
- Use camelCase for utilities
- Use kebab-case for config files

### TypeScript
```typescript
// Good
const emailListId = this.getNodeParameter('emailListId', i) as string;

// Avoid
const id = this.getNodeParameter('emailListId', i);
```

### Error Handling
```typescript
// Always support continueOnFail
try {
    // API call
} catch (error) {
    if (this.continueOnFail()) {
        returnData.push({ error: error.message });
        continue;
    }
    throw error;
}
```
